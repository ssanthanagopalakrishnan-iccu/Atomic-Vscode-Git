# Atomic-Vscode-Git
The purpose of this repository is to save versions of atomic and try to rollback if needed. Since Sabareesh is new to GIT this repository is used to test commit and initial setup.
Now commiting changes Thorugh github. (Not a good practice but ok for initial setup practice.)
This time I am commiting the changes and I will try to create a branch.
